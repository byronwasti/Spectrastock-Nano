Spectrastock-Nano
=================

A version of the Spectrastock (https://github.com/byronwasti/SpectraStock) that is extra small.

Made in order to re-use printrbot Jr. parts in a Delta-bot configuration.


===============
A design based on the original Rostock (https://github.com/jcrocholl/rostock) which allows for easy implementation of a Spectra-line driven system.

Original Rostock frame is still being used. The carriage spectra-line tensioning is based off of what the Tantillus printer did (https://github.com/Intrinsically-Sublime/Tantillus)
